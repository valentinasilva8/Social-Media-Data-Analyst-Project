This project aims to analyze social media engagement by examining the distribution of likes, comparing engagement across different content categories, and identifying the months with the highest average likes. The dataset comprises 500 synthetic social media posts, each associated with a random category, number of likes, and a timestamp indicating the month and year the post was made.

Key Analyses:
- Distribution of Likes: Visualized through a histogram to understand the overall distribution of likes across all posts.
- Likes by Category: Analyzed using boxplots to compare the distribution of likes across different content categories such as Food, Travel, Fashion, etc.
- Statistical Analysis:
Calculated the overall mean of likes.
Determined the mean likes for each category and identified the category with the highest average likes.
- Monthly Analysis: Analyzed the average number of likes per month and identified the month with the highest average likes, visualized through bar plots.
The insights from this analysis can help in understanding which types of content and posting times are most effective in driving engagement on social media platforms.
